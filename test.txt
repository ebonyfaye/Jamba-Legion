We have changed the Config GUI to now use the Default ace config frame. The changes lets you resize the frame. and has now a close button.
We have also added Tooltips when you Hover over the GUI options for a  bit of extra help and to clean up some of the long text.

We have renamed the tab Help to commands as this shows command lines.

Ok, that does the main changes for core, Now let's talk about Jamba-Team.
We have added two new ways to add team members to the team with the command line and GUI.
You can now Use @Target to add a team member that is your current target.
As well we added @MouseOver to add the current MouseOver target to the team lists.

Loot options Have been changed you can now only set Free for all, Personal Loot and Group Loot. 
All the other options have been removed.
Note: That the only place loot options work in Legion is in PVE Instances! 

Now it's time to talk about Jamba-Quest-Tracker

This has had some of the biggest changes. 1st it's Been renamed from Quest Watcher.

We now fully support Scenario Objectives and Bonus Scenario Objectives.
This means that Objectives now show in PVE Instances.

We have added support to change the font And text size so you can make this look nice with your UI.

Time to Talk About Jamba-Quest:

You can now stack Them up to 10 characters high.
and then it makes a new row.

Values are now Abbreviated to smaller Numbers. 

It no longer Shows max Value if showing Percentages. 

We have added support to change the font And text sizes!,

Added a NewTooltip when you hover over the follow bar to show:

    Artifact XP, Show the players weapon Artifact XP.
    Show Honor XP, Show a bar for the new honor xp bar.

Now it's time to talk about Jamba-Toon.
